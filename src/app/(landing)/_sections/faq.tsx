      question: "What is this website for?",
      answer: (
        <span>
          I made this website as a free alternative to UXTweak and Optimal Workshop (which can be
          costly) to help students, UX designers, and researchers create tree tests. Card sorting
          will be added soon.

    //   question: "Why is it called UsabiliTree?",
    //   answer: (
    //     <span>
    //       UsabiliTree is a portmanteau of usability and tree. It&apos;s a play on the words
    //       usability and tree test. At first, I only wanted to build a tree test tool and bought that
    //       domain name, but I decided to add a card sort tool as well.
    //     </span>

      question: "Is this tool free?",
      answer: (
        <span>
          Yes, everything is free. I will soon add limitations for free users, but I will always
          offer a free plan.

      question: "How often is it updated?",
      answer: (
        <span>
          I&apos;ll try to update it as often as possible, but I can&apos;t make any promises. If
          you have any suggestions or requests, please let me know through GitHub issues.
